      Data as of 2015</br></br>

      <strong>Percentage of the total population using improved water sources.</strong> An “improved”
      source is one that is likely to provide "safe" water, such as a household
      connection, a borehole, etc. Current information does not allow yet to establish
      a relationship between access to safe water and access to improved sources,
      but WHO and UNICEF are examining this relationship.</br></br>

      <strong>Total Dam Capacity:</strong> Total cumulative storage capacity of
      all dams in each country. The value indicates the sum of the theoretical initial
      capacities of all dams, which does not change with time. The amount of water
      stored within any dam is likely less than the capacity due to silting. Data
      on small dams may not be included, although their aggregate storage capacity
      is generally not significant.</br></br>
