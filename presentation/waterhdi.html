    <h2>Water's Relationship to HDI</h2>

      HDI data as of 2014. Water Stress and data as of 2012. Water Access data as of 2015</br></br>
      <strong>Total freshwater withdrawn in a given year</strong>, expressed in
      percentage of the total renewable water resources (TRWR). This parameter is
      an indication of the pressure on the renewable water resources. It is the
      Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Indicator 7.5 and the Sustainable Development
      Goal (SDG) indicator 6.4.2.</br></br>

      <strong>Percentage of the total population using improved water sources.</strong> An “improved”
      source is one that is likely to provide "safe" water, such as a household
      connection, a borehole, etc. Current information does not allow yet to establish
      a relationship between access to safe water and access to improved sources,
      but WHO and UNICEF are examining this relationship.</br></br>

      <strong>Human Development Index (HDI):</strong> This is a summary measure
      of human development. It measures the average achievements in a country in
      three basic dimensions of human development: (1) a long and healthy life,
      as measured by life expectancy at birth; (2) knowledge, as measured by the
      adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weight) and the combined primary, secondary
      and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weight); (3) a decent
      standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita (Purchasing Power Parity
      or PPP US$). (Measure is from 0 to 1). </br></br>
